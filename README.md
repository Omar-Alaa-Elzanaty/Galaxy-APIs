# Galaxy

Galaxy Api is a collection of some endpoints to handle shopping, and selling operations for mobile stores.
This project is based on a real freelance job I did for a customer in Deutschland. The project was
built depending on clean architecture to facilitate maintenance and extendability for features in the future.
With a good UI and front end, I think this project will be helpful for any mobile store. The Media folders upload to the same
server. Migrations are important as they initiate the stored procedure required for generating barcodes for items of products.
System response can return in Arabic or Deutsch relying on the header of your request.

## Stored procedure

I needed to create a stored procedure to  delegate barcode generation for all items for the database server to keep the performance of the backend server.

> [!NOTE]
> We can use Ado instead of the stored procedure and entity framework but I still searching for a way to do that as it will be a faster solution. :loudspeaker:

## System Actors & roles

The system currently works on the Owner role only but these roles found also on the system

+ **Moderator**
+ **SalesMan**

## BarCode

### Barcode `algorithm` works by this mechanism

The first four digits represent the year
- The second four digits represent the Order of product in the database as obtained by Product count + 1
- The third five digits represent the order of items of the same product as generated by the last item code of items for the same product + 1



|     Year      |    ProductId  |     ItemCode   |    Result
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -----------
|     0024      |      0001     |      00000     | 0024000100000
|     0024      |      0001     |      00001     | 0024000100001
|     0024      |      0002     |      00000     | 0024000200000
|     0024      |      0002     |      00001     | 0024000200001
